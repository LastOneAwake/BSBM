                    HIFU / Ultherapy is a non-invasive rejuvenation treatment that lifts and tightens skin.

                    <br/>
                    Our non-surgical treatments can reverse those signs of aging.
                    HIFU/ Ultherapy helps by stimulating the cells, resulting in tissue rejuvenation and collagen production.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    By using micro-focused ultrasound technology we can stimulate tissue rejuvenation and collagen production,
                    the overall goal and effect of the treatment is to promote tightening and lifting of the skin in the treated areas.

                    <span className='focus'>How long does it take to see the changes?</span>
                    <br />
                    The production of new collagen takes time, so results can become more apparent over two to three months, even up to six months in some.
